# Cyber Bullying Detection on Social Media Platform using Machine Learning

As individuals passionate about understanding language and social media trends, we initiated a project aimed at identifying cyberbullying using Bengali language data. Cyberbullying, a prevalent problem on social platforms, can be addressed through machine learning techniques. By automating the detection process, we strive to enhance online safety.
## Overview

Cyberbullying detection involves the use of machine learning techniques to analyze text data and identify instances of abusive or harmful behavior. In this project, We focused on leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify text data from social media posts written in Bengali. By training models on annotated datasets, we aimed to develop accurate classifiers capable of detecting cyberbullying in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Employed for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming.
- **Scikit-learn**: Leveraged for building machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Potential libraries for building deep learning models for cyberbullying detection.
- **GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration, providing a centralized repository for project files and code.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Employed for interactive development and experimentation with data and models.
- **TfidfVectorizer**: Used to convert text data into numerical features for machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Utilized for data visualization and result analysis.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a sufficient amount of Bengali text data from social media platforms, ensuring it is annotated with labels indicating instances of cyberbullying.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, digits, and applying stemming to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
3. **Model Development**: Train machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost on the preprocessed text data to classify instances of cyberbullying.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

By following these steps and leveraging the mentioned technologies, we aimed to develop an effective cyberbullying detection system capable of enhancing online safety on social media platforms for Bengali-speaking users.
